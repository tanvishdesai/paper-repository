Which of the following is TRUE about the database system that uses the above algorithm to prevent deadlocks?\n(A) The database system is both deadlock-free and starvation-free.\n(B) The database system is deadlock-free, but not starvation-free.\n(C) The database system is starvation-free, but not deadlock-free.\n(D) The database system is neither deadlock-free nor starvation-free.",
